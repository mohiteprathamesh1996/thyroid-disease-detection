# Thyroid Disease Detection
This repository contains a data science project aiming to predict the risk of thyroid disease in patients. The project follows a classical machine learning workflow, including data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and testing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/thyroid-disease-prediction.git
    cd thyroid-disease-prediction
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Follow the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in numerical order to understand the project workflow.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the data science process.
- `scripts/`: Any additional scripts used in data preprocessing or model evaluation.
- `results/`: Stores model evaluation metrics, visualizations, and any other output.
